# LinkCrypt
> One-Stop Solution for Securing Links
> We are literally flooded with links in our daily life. The authenticity and the origin of many links are not known to us. Some websites might contain malicious activities or they may be phishing websites. This hack enables the link-sharing entities to provide a security assurance by providing some metadata related to the URL and it's content. All this metadata is stored in the blockchain making it immutable and also allowing link openers to validate the originality of the URL.
